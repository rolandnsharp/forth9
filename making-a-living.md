# Making a Living with Forth9

How to generate income from the sovereign handheld project while staying independent. No venture capital, no app stores, no corporate dependencies.

---

## Phase 1 — Now (While Learning Forth)

**Keep the Node.js job.** Forth9 is the side project. Don't quit anything.

- Build Forth skills daily on the Pico 2W
- Document the journey — blog posts, short videos, forum posts
- Build a presence in the Forth community (Forth 2020 group, ClockworkPi forum, ham radio clubs)

**Cost:** $0. **Revenue:** $0. **Duration:** 3-6 months.

## Phase 2 — First Services (Once You Can Build Things)

### LoRa Network Installation
- Farmers, rural businesses, warehouses, community groups — anyone without cell signal
- Gate monitors, weather stations, soil sensors, asset tracking
- Charge for installation + monthly maintenance
- Your PicoCalc is the admin terminal and the demo

### Mesh Communication Setup
- Neighbourhoods wanting off-grid communication
- Event organisers needing temporary networks
- Disaster preparedness groups
- Small hardware cost ($15-30 per node), labour is the value

### Ham Radio Services
- Get your amateur radio licence
- Offer antenna installation, digital mode setup
- Decode and relay services for remote properties
- The Forth9 device running HF/VHF is your calling card

**Pricing:** Charge per installation + optional monthly support retainer.
**Revenue target:** Side income, $500-2000/month.
**Sovereignty:** You own every tool. No platform takes a cut.

## Phase 3 — Teach (Once You Know Enough to Explain)

### Workshops
- "Build Your Own Mesh Network" — half-day workshop, $50-100/head
- "Forth for Embedded Systems" — weekend workshop for engineers
- "Sovereign Computing" — for preppers, off-grid communities, privacy groups
- Run locally, no platform needed. A room, a projector, PicoCalcs for students.

### Online Content
- Written tutorials (blog, not Medium — host it yourself)
- Video series: "Building a Computer from Scratch in Forth"
- Course on LoRa mesh networking with Forth
- Sell direct or use a simple platform (Gumroad, own site)

**Revenue target:** $1000-3000/month.
**Sovereignty:** Self-hosted content. No algorithm decides who sees it.

## Phase 4 — Sell Hardware (Once the Software Works)

### Pre-loaded PicoCalcs
- Buy PicoCalc kits, install Forth9, sell as a ready-to-use sovereign handheld
- The hardware is someone else's. The image — your dictionary, your tools — is the product
- Sell through your own site or at maker fairs and ham fests

### LoRa Node Kits
- RP2040/RP2350 + SX1262 + solar panel + weatherproof case
- Pre-programmed with Forth9 mesh firmware
- Sell as "drop and forget" sensor/relay nodes
- $50-80 per kit, components cost $15-25

### Custom Forth9 Board (Long-term)
- Design a purpose-built board: RP2350 + LoRa + PSRAM + battery + small display
- Smaller than PicoCalc, built for Forth9 specifically
- Open source the design, sell assembled boards
- Partner with PCB fab (PCBWay, JLCPCB) for production

**Revenue target:** $3000-10000/month at scale.
**Sovereignty:** You design it, you build it, you sell it direct. No app store, no middleman.

## Phase 5 — The Bitcoin Loop

- Build a Forth9 Bitcoin wallet (cold storage + signing)
- Accept Bitcoin for all services and hardware
- Customers who use your mesh network can pay over it
- The device that earns the money also holds the money

---

## Phase 6 — The Forth Cluster (Speculative)

- Home lab of networked RP2350s or GA144 boards
- Offer compute services: signal processing, search indexing, data analysis
- Your PicoCalc as the portable terminal to the cluster
- Niche but unique — nobody else offers Forth-native parallel compute

---

## Principles

1. **Open source the software, sell the hardware and services.** The code brings the community. The community buys the boards.
2. **No venture capital.** Bootstrap from services. Grow slow.
3. **No platforms.** Sell direct. Your website, ham fests, maker fairs, word of mouth.
4. **No recurring cloud costs.** Everything runs on hardware you own.
5. **Eat your own cooking.** Use Forth9 for everything — invoicing, notes, communication, payments. The best demo is daily use.
6. **The device sells itself.** Show up, use it in front of people. The conversation starts naturally.
